    "So the data shows a good explanation for this tremendous higher survival rate from Cherbourg passengers: they are far more well-off (in average) than the rest of the passengers.\n",

    "- the poor Irish is confirmed (2,9)\n",
    "- the persons boarding in Cherboug are in far higher classes (1.9) indicating wealthier passengers\n",
    "\n",
    "And we already demonstrated that those passengers would have higher survival rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "There might be a pratical explanation: \n",
    "1. as the Titanic was a British vessel, mostly English-leaning passengers would board it.\n",
    "2. French speaking passengers would rather board French ships in Cherbourg (having mostlikely similar demographics than from Southampton)\n",
    "3. So, passengers boarding on the Titanic in Cherbourg would be English speakers being in France: so tourists or businessman, so **wealthy persons** (look at the outliers with a nearly 10 times standard deviation)\n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a link with boarding in Cherbourg and surviving, but **correlation is not causalation !!!!**"
